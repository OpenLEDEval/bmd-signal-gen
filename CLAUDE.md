# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is a cross-platform BMD (Blackmagic Design) signal generator that
outputs test patterns via DeckLink devices. It consists of:

- **C++ core**: Low-level DeckLink SDK wrapper with pixel format conversion
  (`cpp/`)
- **Python wrapper**: High-level interface via ctypes (`bmd_sg/`)
- **REST API**: FastAPI-based HTTP interface for pattern generation
- **CLI tool**: Command-line interface for direct pattern output

## Build Commands

Use the automated build system:

```bash
uv run invoke build
```

This builds `bmd_sg/decklink/libdecklink.dylib` and the Python package.

## Development Guidelines

### Critical Standards (from .cursor/rules/coding-standards.mdc)

- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate duplicate logic, especially switch/case
  statements for pixel formats
- **Centralized Logic**: Use helpers/utilities rather than repeating
  validation/conversion code
- **Refactor Immediately**: Don't defer deduplication - fix patterns when found
- **All Languages**: Apply DRY to C++, Python, and build scripts

### Documentation Standards

All Python code must use **Sphinx-compatible docstrings** following **NumPy
documentation standards**.

#### Required Documentation

1. **All public modules** must have comprehensive module-level docstrings
2. **All public classes** must have detailed class docstrings with Parameters,
   Attributes, Examples, and Notes sections
3. **All public functions and methods** must have complete docstrings with
   Parameters, Returns, Raises, and Examples sections
4. **All public constants and enums** must be documented with brief descriptions

#### NumPy Docstring Format

Use these sections in docstrings:

- **Parameters** - Document all parameters with types and descriptions
- **Returns** - Document return values with types and descriptions
- **Raises** - Document all exceptions that can be raised
- **Examples** - Include practical usage examples with expected output
- **Notes** - Important implementation details or performance considerations
- **See Also** - Cross-references to related functionality

#### Example Class Docstring

```python
class HDRMetadata(ctypes.Structure):
    """
    Complete HDR metadata structure for DeckLink output.

    This structure defines comprehensive HDR metadata including EOTF
    (Electro-Optical Transfer Function), display primaries, and luminance values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eotf : int, optional
        EOTF type (0=Reserved, 1=SDR, 2=PQ, 3=HLG). Default is 3.
    max_display_luminance : float, optional
        Maximum display mastering luminance in cd/mÂ². Default is 1000.0.

    Attributes
    ----------
    EOTF : int
        Electro-Optical Transfer Function type
    referencePrimaries : ChromaticityCoordinates
        Display color primaries and white point

    Examples
    --------
    Create HDR metadata with default values:

    >>> metadata = HDRMetadata()
    >>> print(f"EOTF: {metadata.EOTF}")
    EOTF: 3

    Notes
    -----
    The structure automatically sets Rec.2020 color primaries as defaults.
    """
```

#### Documentation Quality Requirements

- **Complete parameter documentation** - All parameters must be documented with
  types and descriptions
- **Practical examples required** - Include real-world usage examples
- **Exception documentation** - Document all exceptions that can be raised
- **Cross-references** - Use See Also sections to link related functionality
- **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms throughout the project

### HDR Metadata Handling

The project supports complete HDR metadata with:

- EOTF (Electro-Optical Transfer Function) specification
- Display primaries (Rec2020 by default)
- Mastering display luminance values
- MaxCLL/MaxFALL content light levels
- **MaxCLL default value for this project is 10,000 nits**
- Default HDR values do not reflect industry standards, but instead particular
  traits for disabling tone mapping or other automatic conversions in certain
  displays.

### Device Management

- Global device state is maintained in `decklink_control.py` for API usage
- Device enumeration happens at initialization
- Pixel format auto-selection prefers 12-bit RGB formats
- Multiple devices can be targeted by index

## Testing

Use `uv run invoke test` to run the test suite.

## Common Issues

- **Library Loading**: Ensure `libdecklink.dylib` is built and in correct
  location
- **Device Access**: Requires BMD Desktop Video drivers and proper device
  connection
- **Pixel Format**: Some formats may not be supported by all devices
- **HDR Metadata**: Complete metadata structure required for proper HDR output

## Dependencies

See DEVELOPERS.md for complete setup instructions including prerequisites and
SDK installation.

## Claude Code Guidelines

- **Refactoring Workflow**:
  - Always make refactor suggestions using edit or multi edit tools so I can see
    the changes in my diff browser
  - Only use code snippets in the chat when I ask for an example or a clarifying
    question
  - When asked for refactor suggestions, first describe suggestions briefly with
    minimal code in the chat
  - Wait for explicit confirmation before using edit or multi edit tools to
    implement refactoring

### Code Quality Guidelines

- Always try to add a return type and type annotations to all functions
- Do not write functions that return `Optional` types or types that are
  sometimes None unless doing so adds functionality to the program. If a
  function cannot compelte correctly, it should raise an error rather than
  returning None.

### Development Environment Management

- Use uv and uvx instead of using pip directly. This project uses uv to manage
  the development environment and development dependencies.

### Project Testing

- Claude can run `python -m bmd_sg.cli.main` to test the cli for the project and
  user interface

### Module Maintenance Guidelines

- Where a module has an **all** declaration, make sure to keep it up to date by
  searching for usages of that module's public members. Ensure their usage and
  documentation are up to date with the latest changes.

### Development Tools

- AI Agents should use `uv run ai-developer-quality` to run quality checks while
  developing. Some of the checks modify files, so claude will need to re-read
  files.
- If the `ai-developer-quality` returns errors for code unrelated to the current
  project, agents may request to put code check comments around the violating
  code to bypass the check. Agents must always get explicit permission to do
  this and must remove the bypass after finishing their current project.
- Use `uv run ruff` for linting and `uv run pyright` for type checking. Check
  @tasks.py to see other developer tools claude can consider using.

## Developer Guidelines

- Read @DEVELOPERS.md for additional guidance.
- Check @.memories for additional guidance.

### CLI Development

- If there are more 3 related options, and there are more than 2 logical option
  groups, then update the CLI to belong in option groups in typer.
- If there are a small number of options, option groups are not necessary.
