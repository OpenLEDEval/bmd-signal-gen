# Examples Directory Guidelines

This directory contains simple, straightforward Python scripts that demonstrate BMD Signal Generator library functionality for maintainers, new contributors, and learning purposes.

## Philosophy

- **Minimal boilerplate**: Scripts focus on core functionality demonstrations
- **Linear structure**: No complex functions or classes unless absolutely necessary  
- **Direct imports**: Use library components directly without abstraction layers
- **Clear patterns**: Show practical usage patterns for common tasks
- **Educational value**: Help users understand library capabilities quickly

## Example Types

- **Pattern demos**: Show how to generate and display different test patterns
- **Performance tests**: Demonstrate timing and throughput measurements
- **Basic usage**: Simple scripts showing fundamental operations

## Guidelines for New Examples

- Keep scripts under 100 lines when possible
- Use clear variable names and minimal comments
- Import only what's needed
- Show real-world usage patterns
- Include timing or visual feedback where appropriate
- No complex error handling unless it demonstrates library features

These are demonstration scripts, not production code or user interfaces.
