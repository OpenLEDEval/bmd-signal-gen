# Examples Directory Guidelines

Simple Python scripts demonstrating BMD Signal Generator library functionality for maintainers, contributors, and learning.

## Philosophy

**Minimal boilerplate**: Focus on core functionality demonstrations  
**Linear structure**: No complex functions/classes unless necessary  
**Direct imports**: Use library components without abstraction layers  
**Clear patterns**: Show practical usage for common tasks  
**Educational value**: Help users understand library capabilities quickly

## Example Types

**Pattern demos**: Generate and display different test patterns  
**Performance tests**: Timing and throughput measurements  
**Basic usage**: Simple scripts showing fundamental operations

## Guidelines for New Examples

- Keep scripts under 100 lines
- Use clear variable names, minimal comments
- Import only what's needed
- Show real-world usage patterns
- Include timing/visual feedback
- No complex error handling unless demonstrating library features

Demonstration scripts, not production code or user interfaces.
